Revisiting my earlier bookKeeper app and adding a backend.

This was a passion project for me as I am an avid reader. I wanted to see if I could create a simplified version of what Goodreads does.

I also wanted to use some of the skills I have been working on.

This uses React with Typescript in the front end. I used React Query to handle the calls to the backend API. 

It gave me a chance to redesign the look of the site as well. I used Styled Components to style it. I really liked being able to compartmentalize the styles and that you can use SCSS-like syntax. 

I built the back end with NodeJS, Express, and MySQL for the database. For authentication I used jwt and bcrypt. I used Typescript in the back end as well. MySQL Workbench was very handy for interacting with the db.

This is a work and progress and I am continuing to see what else I can do with it!
